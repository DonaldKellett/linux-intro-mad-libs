When you're just starting out with Linux, it's easy to get <simplePastVerb>.

You probably <rootVerb> only Windows, but now you want to <rootVerb> Linux because you <simplePastVerb> that Linux is better than Windows as it's more <descriptiveAdjective> and you don't have to <rootVerb> a(n) <singularNoun> to <rootVerb> Linux.

But then when you go about <presentParticipleVerb> and <presentParticipleVerb> Linux, you learn that Linux is not a single entity. There's <properNoun>, <properNoun>, <properNoun>, <properNoun> and hundreds of other 'Linux variants'. The trouble is that some of them look just like the others.

If that's the case, why are there so many Linux <pluralNoun>? And then you also learn that Linux is just a(n) <singularNoun>, not a(n) <singularNoun>.

It gets <descriptiveAdjective>. And you may feel like <presentParticipleVerb> your <collectiveNoun> out. As someone with a <descriptiveAdjective> <singularNoun>, I would like you to keep your own <collectiveNoun> intact by <presentParticipleVerb> things in a way you can easily <rootVerb>.

I'm going to use a(n) <singularNoun> to explain why Linux is just a(n) <singularNoun>, why there are hundreds of types of Linux and why, despite looking similar, they are different.

The <singularNoun> here may not be considered <descriptiveAdjective> enough for a(n) <singularNoun> in a(n) <singularNoun> or <singularNoun>, but it should given you a better <singularNoun> of the <singularNoun>.
